# Tweet Artist AI

This repo provides the code to create a bot that listens for mentions on Twitter and illustrates the Tweet to which the mention is a reply to. The bot uses the [Tweepy library](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/index.html) to interact with the Twitter APIs to get tweet information and post tweet on behalf of the bot. It uses the Open AI library to interact with Open AI [Dall-E](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/images) model to generate images.
